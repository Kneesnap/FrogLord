# jPSXdec

This folder contains select components of [jPSXdec](https://github.com/m35/jpsxdec), a project used for PSX audio/video processing.  

We would prefer to use jPSXdec as a dependency/library instead, but no such library distribution of jPSXdec exists.  
As such, the following code has been copied directly from the jPSXdec source repository. (Code Date: September 23rd, 2025.)
