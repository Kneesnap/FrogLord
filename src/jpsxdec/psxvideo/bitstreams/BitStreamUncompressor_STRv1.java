/** Rather uncommon STR "version 1" video frame format.
 * Identical to STRv2, but has a version of 1 in the header.
 * Used in FF7, FF Tactics, and Tekken 2 (and probably others).
 *<p>
 * FF7 video also contains run-length codes where AC is 0.
 * This case obviously works with PlayStation hardware, so is already
 * accepted by the STRv2 uncompressor to make things simpler, faster, and
 * more robust (because AC=0 may occur in games besides FF7). See
 * {@link BitStreamUncompressor_STRv2#readEscapeAcCode(jpsxdec.psxvideo.mdec.MdecCode)}.
 *<p>
 * I suspect the reason for this FF7 AC=0 waste is because they compressed the
 * frames further to fit camera data. This led to AC values being reduced,
 * some falling to 0, but they didn't merge those codes to save space.
