/**
 * An aggregate template is a special kind of template.
 * It operates like an array, but it allows calling the methods of each as if they are a single unit.
 * For example, when we create NPC clones of all players in the cutscene, each player gets their own NPC.
 * However, this would be very annoying for chroniclers to have to iterate through / know they need to iterate through.
 * So, this system allows a single object to be used as an aggregate proxy for multiple underlying objects.
 * In the future, if we ever support arrays, we should allow the array accessor on this template, to handle conflict situations.
 * For example, if you have clones with different locations, using the "location" getter will result in an error.
