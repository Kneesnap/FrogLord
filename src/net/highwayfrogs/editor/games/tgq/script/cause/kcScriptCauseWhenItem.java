/**
 * The scripting system has no support for conditional statements.
 * For instance, you can't say "If player has item, do X"
 * This is how they got around this.
 * The script action 'WITHITEM {itemType}' will fire functions with this cause.
 * This can specify whether it should run if the item is found or if it is not found.
 * This way, you can for example, handle planting a seed but only if they have a seed to plant.
 * Or alternatively, show a message if a player is trying to open a door they need a key for.
