    // So... why is PI funky?
    // When reverse engineering the proper math for Frogger path calculations, I was just slightly off.
    // I was confident I had the right algorithm but the values I was getting were slightly off. Instead of 0.5 for the path arc angle I'd get 0.499984......
    // Eventually, I tried solving for PI. What I got was consistent across different path arcs, and makes the angles look accurate.
    // This made no sense UNTIL I searched GitHub. This number is the most accurate representation of PI for a 16 bit floating point number.
    // Soooo, I think this suggests mappy may have been using 16 bit floating point numbers for certain operations?? If so that... actually makes sense.
    // Some paths still don't calculate cleanly, but the fact that this is a real recognized stand-in for Pi and works across a good chunk of paths makes me think it's correct.
    // Though it's possible the ones which don't calculate cleanly were changed via GUI slider, much like the slider seen in FrogLord UI.
    // I think this is the case since many of the non-even paths don't look right if you put the clean number in.
