# Fixing the PC Port of Frogger: The Great Quest
The PC port of Frogger: The Great Quest suffers from many framerate-related issues, including crashes.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these steps will need to be done every time you reboot your computer or shut down the relevant programs.  
> Follow the check-list at the bottom of the file if you are not sure if you have followed the steps correctly.

## Step 1) DxWnd
DxWnd is a program used to fix old games to run properly on modern versions of Windows.
It is used to fix some of the problems with the game.

**a) Download DxWnd**  
Create a folder called `DxWnd` somewhere memorable (e.g. inside `<root folder>\PC` if you're following the modding guide).   
Download DxWnd [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/), and extract it into the `DxWnd` folder.

**b) Setup DxWnd**  
After opening `DxWnd.exe`, drag and drop `GreatQuest.exe` into `DxWnd`.  
Luckily, DxWnd fixes most of the game issues with its default settings, and even runs the game in a window.  

To fix the text displaying at incorrect places:
- Main > Force Windowing > Make sure the checkbox is checked.
- Video > Screen Resolution > Set to SD+HD (Makes the game render at a higher resolution)

But in order to make the game not listen to keyboard input while it's not in focus, change the following settings:
- Input > Suspend GetAsyncKeyState > Make sure the checkbox is checked.
- Input > Hook dinput > Make sure the checkbox is checked.

**c) Save your changes**  
DxWnd does not auto-save, so after making your changes make sure to save them from the main menu with `File > Save`.  

> [!Important]  
> DxWnd must be running for it to work. This means if you close DxWnd or restart your computer, it will no longer be active.  
> So make sure DxWnd is running before starting the game.  

## Step 2) RivaTuner
Unfortunately, DxWnd doesn't seem to be able to properly cap the game's framerate to 60 FPS.  
Many issues can occur such as excessively high/low jumps, goobers getting stuck midair, excessive crashing, etc.  
RivaTuner is the best program we've found for clamping the framerate, and it even comes with a nice on-screen FPS indicator.  

**a) Install RivaTuner**  
Download RivaTuner [here](https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download/) and install it.  
Be careful not to download it from other sources that pretend to be official but contain malware.  

**b) Configure RivaTuner for Great Quest**  
When opening RivaTuner, its may be hidden. If that happens, look for the icon in the system tray of the Windows taskbar.  
Click the green "Add" button to add `GreatQuest.exe` to RivaTuner.  
Then, set the `Framerate limit` to 60.  

**c) Try running the game**  
If RivaTuner has been successfully setup, the framerate will be drawn to the screen in large orange text while the game is running.  

> [!Important]  
> Just like DxWnd, if RivaTuner is closed, it will stop working.  
> So if the orange framerate counter isn't seen when launching the game, make sure RivaTuner is actually running.  
> Also, if the framerate counter is shown but above 60FPS, double-check you've set the `Framerate limit` correctly.

## Final Checklist
- [ ] **DxWnd is running** – `DxWnd.exe` is open and has `GreatQuest.exe` listed
- [ ] **Windowed mode works** – Game runs in a window, not fullscreen
- [ ] **Text displays properly** – No weird offset or missing HUD text
- [ ] **RivaTuner is running** – Orange FPS counter is visible on screen
- [ ] **FPS is capped at 60** – Counter reads 60 FPS, not higher

## Troubleshooting
### The game runs full-screen!
Make sure DxWnd is open and running.
If DxWnd is open, but does not have the `GreatQuest.exe` icon within its main menu, follow the steps for DxWnd again.
On rare occasions, DxWnd may not successfully run the game in a window, so try closing and re-opening the game.

### The game is running, and the orange RivaTuner framerate counter is shown, but it's above 60 FPS.
RivaTuner forgot the framerate limit.  
Open up RivaTuner, and set `GreatQuest.exe`'s framerate limiter to 60.  
Sometimes it may say 60, but still need to be changed to 59 and then back to 60 before it works.

### The game crashes frequently or has more bugs than usual.
Make sure both DxWnd and RivaTuner are currently running, not just setup properly.

### The game crashes often on the main menu.  
This is normal, and we have not yet determined the cause of this crash.
