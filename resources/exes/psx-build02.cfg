# This build contains many entities which fail to load. All of the ones listed below are considered intentionally "unfixed".
# - CAV_FROGGER_LIGHT (CAVM.MAP) (Read: 52, Real: 48). This entity appears in other maps and seems fine in the other maps. As such, it seems that CAV1.MAP may just be an older entity definition than the one in this build.
# - FOR_HIVE (FOR2.MAP) (Read: 40, Real: 36) This entity loads in-game on both FOR1 and FOR2, and crashes when you get near it on both FOR1 and FOR2. However, only FOR2.MAP seems to load the wrong amount of data, suggesting FOR2 is an older export.
# - SUB_BUTTERFLY & SUB_BUTTERFLY2 (FOR345, JUN12345, ARN12345, VOL2345, SUB3, ISLAND). There seem to be three separate entity definitions here. (SUB3: Path data, 12 bytes), (ISLAND.MAP: 32 bytes static), (Other: 24 bytes, unknown). I've chosen to stick with what the form library says.
# - SUB_BUTTERFLY3 (SUB3) Doesn't load ingame. The form library has this as static, but the data seems to be for a path entity. Because the entity doesn't load ingame either, I've chosen to stick with what the ingame form book says.
# - SUB_DOG (SUBM.MAP) -> The dogs in the singleplayer levels load correctly, so this is an older export.
# - QB.MAP:
#  - Entity Type #1 is seen as a JETTY, and Entity Type #2 is seen as a SUB_LORRY.
#  - Both of these are path followers, but the exact models seen here are probably incorrect.
#  - This map seems to be using an extremely old form library, since it's extremely unlikely that the JETTY entity was intended to follow a path.
#  - Modifications would need to be made exclusively for this level

# The configurations for this build (entity, form, data, etc) have been vetted / appear to be correct.
