# The following textures were made unused VERY late in development.
# They contain text blobs describing the story for each level.
# The retail PSX NTSC version loads a single .TIM file for the selected level, instead of these VLO files.
# These textures do not fit into VRAM when FrogLord tries to fit them, and I suspect the original devs had this problem with Vorg too.
# Therefore, they switched to .TIM files, and stopped making Vorg generate these files.
# HOWEVER, They didn't update their MWD script, and so the most recent .VLO files they had generated were still included in the .MWD.
# This theory is further supported by the idea that these VLO files were fully removed in the PAL version, which had significant changes to the MWD.
# Ultimately, if we group them together with USA_TEXT.VLO (where they were previously grouped), the textures do not fit in VRAM.
# Even the original .VLO files overlap TITLE.VLO, suggesting that they are outdated VLOs/incompatible with the other VLOs in the final game.
