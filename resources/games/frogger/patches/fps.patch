Description=Changes the FPS. This will not be accurate down to the number of frames. # It's as close as it can be though.

# Note from Kneesnap
#  On 3/15/2020 I tried to support decoupling the game logic from the FPS, because I saw two counters which I believed controlled each separately.
#  Unfortunately, while I believe my assembly patch worked, it seems like it was probably just rendering the exact same frame multiple times, because the game tick updated things.

#
# So, at this point it seems unlikely we'll really be able to decouple FPS from game logic without major changes.
