# The entity list didn't change much over time, it just grew.
# Many pre-release game builds use this list because there are no changes, even if this list might have entities not yet implemented in that version.
# The way to tell if a build is newer than this is by checking the ordering of CAV_WEB vs CAV_SPIDER.
