### pikuma.com
[This website](https://pikuma.com/) is made by a university professor who has a deep understanding of various things such as PlayStation programming and 3D rendering.  
He sells courses on stuff like PlayStation programming too, so if you're interested, do check out the website.  
I've gotten permission from the author (via Twitter) to re-use images from his website for FrogLord.  
He did not ask me to mention his courses, but I did it anyway.

**swampy.png:**  
This image is a screenshot of a cutscene in `Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge`, with the background edited out.

Knee's Note:
Having looked over the website, the guy who runs this website clearly knows his stuff.
He sells courses for general game dev stuff, but also older computing like there's a course of PlayStation programming.
In my personal opinion it looks pretty solid, so if you're reading this and might be interested, do check it out.

**All Others:**  
The other images unfortunately did not have their origins tracked. Eventually I plan to see if we can track down those image sources, or replace them.
