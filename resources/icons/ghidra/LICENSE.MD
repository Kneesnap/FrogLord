# Licensing
These icons were used due to my familiarity with their use in [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra).  
They can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/tree/master/Ghidra/Framework/Gui/src/main/resources/images) on the Ghidra source tree.  
The licenses for each image in the Ghidra repository can also be found [here](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/Ghidra/Framework/Gui/certification.manifest).  

They are either public domain, or sourced with one or more of the appropriate licenses below.  
While I'd like to list which images use which licenses, unfortunately, the Ghidra repository does not do this, so I can only provide the same level of licensing information as them.  
These images are provided without modification from the state as they were obtained from the Ghidra repository linked above.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### Oxygen Icons - LGPL 3.0
[License Source](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/licenses/Oxygen_Icons_-_LGPL_3.0.txt)  
**License:**  
```
Using Oxygen Icons Outwith KDE

Like KDE itself, Oxygen Icons have a liberal copying policy. Anyone may, and is encouraged to, use Oxygen Icons in their applications, websites and physical artwork. Modification is also allowed. The only restriction is that you can not restrict what others then do with the artwork.

The copying licence is the GNU LGPL 3, see Policies/Licensing_Policy and LGPL licence text for the full legal details.
Use in Applications

Oxygen Icons can be used with computer programmes, including proprietry applications or ones covered by non-GPL licences.

In your source code you must include a copy of the LGPLv3 licence text making it clear which files it applies to and point to http://www.kde.org/. You must also include the SVG of the relevant icons even if they are not used by the application (this is the preferred modifiable form).

With your application binary you must also include a copy of the LGPLv3 licence text making it clear which files it applies to and point to http://www.kde.org/. If you do not include the icon SVGs you must make it clear how the user can get them (for a free software application this will be as part of the source code).

There is one license issue to watch for with proprietary applications, you should not embed the icon into the application binary. This happens if you use Qt resource files or .net linking. This would mean the whole application is now LGPL. Instead you should keep the .png as a separate file and load it at runtime. (There are provisions in the LGPL for allowing this if you have a mechanism to relink to a modified version but most applications do not have such a mechanism).
Use on Websites

Oxygen Icons can be used on websites, they are excellent for making even the most boring website pretty (look at this one).

You should include a link to http://www.kde.org/ in a prominant and relevant part of your website (e.g. a credits page) and make it clear that the icons may be freely copied under the LGPLv3 (either by linking to the LGPL on the GNU website or by including a full copy). If you have modified the icon SVGs you should include a link to where they can be downloaded.
Use on Physical Media

You can include Oxygen Icons in leaflets or any printed work.

You should include a text pointing readers at the Oxygen website http://www.kde.org/ and note that they can be copied under the GNU LGPLv3 with a pointer to http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html
Notes

The GNU LGPLv3 is a two part document made up of the GPLv3 and the LGPL addon. Both should be included.

Some Oxygen Icons include the KDE logo. The copying licence is just the same but it is also restricted by the separate laws of trademark and may not be used for any branding without licence from KDE e.V.

TODO: Must include GNU LGPL 3 for Oxygen?
TODO: Create a credits page? Oxygen wants stuff. Hrmm. What if we can exclude Oxygen.
