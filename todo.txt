Look into that stupid MWD saving bug. Why does it work on 1.8.0_111, 1.8.0_144, 1.8.0_172, and 1.8.0_181, but not 1.8.0_161, or 1.8.0_201? The broken ones appear to use less RAM, and have spikes when viewing the map.

Map Editor:
 - Fix adding new matrix entities. (They don't show up in-game It seems like invalid matrix, as this can happen if you move an entity.)

v1.0.0:
 - Guide & Functionality for adding textures, even textures from other vlos.
 - Guide for game patches.
 - MOF Editor features listed in MOFController.
 - MOF Importing.
 - MOF Exporting. [Maybe DAE, Maybe https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html]


Future:
 - Spline Editor [@Andy, I don't know what all of this data is, and I don't understand the math behind this. Even if you could just give me some documentation that lets me understand each piece of data, this would be useful.]
 - Reverse official PP20 packer library, or see if Nico is willing to send the code for it.
 - Per-face textures. (This would allow us to show the water in Uncanny Crusher as green, when the texture itself is purple.) (OR, we could generate overlay faces with semi-transparent materials which will apply the correct color.)
 - Add support for selecting multiple grid squares and applying flags.
