Editor Features:

MOF File:
 Import mofs from mm3d.

Look into that stupid MWD saving bug. Why does it work on 1.8.0_111, 1.8.0_144, 1.8.0_172, and 1.8.0_181, but not 1.8.0_161, or 1.8.0_201? The broken ones appear to use less RAM, and have spikes when viewing the map.
See if anything can be done about using the swamp VLO as a texture for 3D things. It seems some laptop computers do not like this and display everything as black with a message in the console.
Eventually have some method which can allocate space into an executable at a given space so we could for instance add a new level into the level selector. This would need to modify pointers.

Issues / Features:
 - PP20 compressor is not very efficient. Could we make an algorithm that is as good as the original one? Disassemble the original packer.
 - Entities need some kind of height offset in the map viewer. Figure out how the game figures out this height thing.
 - Full PSX VLO Support. (Missing support for certain types of images like the level select)

UI Plans:
 - VRAM Editor kinda stinks. It would be nice to try and create a system to generate this automatically, or maybe show boundaries of other texture banks.

Map Editor:
 - Add polygons.
 - Better polygon editor.
 - Adding entities: Have a selector that lets you pick the entity type you want to make, instead of cloning the current one. The camera should focus in on the new entity at the very least, if we can't let the user decide where to place it. We could disable the create entity button if there is no tile selected (tile must be under a path if it's a path entity)
 - Form Resizing? General resizing of fixed size things?
 - Path editor shows selected path, which updates as you update the path information.
 - Path editor needs to be fully editable. Add spline data and verify other types are editable.
