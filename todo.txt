Look into that stupid MWD saving bug. Why does it work on 1.8.0_111, 1.8.0_144, 1.8.0_172, and 1.8.0_181, but not 1.8.0_161, or 1.8.0_201? The broken ones appear to use less RAM, and have spikes when viewing the map.

Map Editor:
 - Add polygons.
 - Better polygon editor.
 - Fix adding new matrix entities. (They don't show up in-game)
 - Would it be efficient to display the map by adding each poly as a mesh view? It could result in much better map controls. It also may be terrible. [May fix display on laptops?]

Future:
 - Spline Editor [@Andy, I don't know what all of this data is, and I don't understand the math behind this. Even if you could just give me some documentation that lets me understand each piece of data, this would be useful.]
 - Support Gouraud shading on things like MAPPolyG4. [Andy Eder?] (We could finally show accurate textures in the map view.) I believe this can be achieved by making a GouraudMaterial class which works similar to PhongMaterial, but with Gouraud shading.
 - Import mofs from MM3D.
 - MOF Editor.
 - Reverse official PP20 packer library, or see if Nico is willing to send the code for it.
 - Perfect path position calculation. It's fairly close right now. Go over the code for all of the paths to make sure it's accurate, and then go over how it gets used to make sure it gets used properly.
 - If possible, an automatic space allocator. Something that would let us, let's say... add bytes into the level struct to let us add a new level! It would need to account for pointers, and it would probably be a PC-only feature.
